## Tari Release v0.8.5

This release is a minor release mainly containing fixes and updates to the wallet libraries that the mobile Tari Aurora apps use.

Binaries are available [here](https://www.tari.com/downloads)

## Tari Script RFC up for comments

[RFC 201](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0201_TariScript.html) and [RFC 202](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0202_TariScriptOpcodes.html) relating to Tari Script have recently been merged into the development branch. In RFC stage they are still up for scrutiny and comment. The development community will start implementing these in the near future, so it's a great time to read through them and have your say.
