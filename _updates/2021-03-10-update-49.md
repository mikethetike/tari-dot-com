## Tari Release v0.8.6

This release contains a fix for nodes running with a pruning horizon ([#2677](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2677)), as well as the final separation of wallet from the base node.

Binaries are available [here](https://www.tari.com/downloads)

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Testing with Cucumber

You may have noticed a lot of PR's and commits with the word "cucumber" in them. Tari uses [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), and specifically [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) to easily specify test scenarios in plain text. The tests can be found under the [integration_tests/features](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/tree/development/integration_tests/features) folder. The tests spin up base nodes, merge mining proxies and miners in a local, low difficulty network and interact with them via GRPC, simulating various scenarios that might happen on testnet.

The plain text method of specifying tests makes it easy to read, write and verify correctness of the tests.

Here's a simple example that tests submitting blocks:

```gherkin

   Scenario: Mining example
      Given I have 3 seed nodes
      And I have a base node MINER connected to all seed nodes
      When I mine 20 blocks on MINER
      # All nodes should sync to tip
      Then all nodes are at height 20

```

And here's an example of a test submitting a transaction:

```gherkin

  Scenario: As a wallet I want to submit a transaction
    Given I have a seed node SEED_A
    When I mine a block on SEED_A with coinbase CB1
    And I mine 2 blocks on SEED_A
    And I create a transaction TX1 spending CB1 to UTX1
    And I submit transaction TX1 to SEED_A
    Then TX1 is in the mempool
    When I mine 1 blocks on SEED_A
    Then the UTXO UTX1 has been mined according to SEED_A

```

There's not much more to it, and this is a really simple entry point to help contribute. If you get stuck, pop into the #tari-dev IRC on freenode and ask a question.
