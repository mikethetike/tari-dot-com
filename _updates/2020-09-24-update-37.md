It's been a few hairy weeks since the last update. We had testnet stop for a bit and some large reorgs since adding
merge mined Monero blocks to the chain. Although the large forks weren't intended, it allowed us to find and fix a number
of bugs. There's still some work to be done, but the network is getting more resilient all the time.

Here's some of the highlights since v0.5.3

- Many fixes and updates to `tari_merge_mining_proxy`. This program proxies requests from RandomX miners to
  [monerod](https://web.getmonero.org/) in order to allow mining TXTR and Monero at the same time
- Implement transaction negotiation message resending in the wallet
- Implement LMDB automatic resizing during sync
