## Tari Base Node v0.8.8 Released

Tari Base Node v0.8.8 has been released. It is a minor release, but includes a fix that should prevent network splits due to blocks being overwritten
in the LMDB database by competing threads. The development community noticed that base nodes would calculate the target difficulty incorrectly when there was a large number of transactions in blocks. This increased the time taken to propagate blocks and resulted in a number of small one block reorgs.
It was also possible to start mining on a base node while it was syncing, causing an unpredictable state in the database. These issues have been fixed in this release.
